Here's a prompt you can give to a Replit AI agent to help it build "DepSimplify", our hypothetical dependency management tool for Python:

---

**Project: DepSimplify - A Python Dependency Management Tool**

**Objective**: Your task is to develop a Python package named "DepSimplify" that simplifies dependency management by:

1. **Automated Dependency Resolution**:
   - Use Python's `setuptools` or a similar tool to define and manage dependencies.
   - Implement a system where dependencies are automatically resolved based on compatibility rules or user-defined preferences.

2. **Interactive Command Line Interface (CLI)**:
   - Create an interactive CLI using a library like `click` or `argparse`, which allows users to:
     - View and manage project dependencies.
     - Resolve conflicts interactively by presenting options for version compatibility.
     - Suggest updates to dependencies that would cause the least disruption to the project.

3. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Develop algorithms or integrate existing ones (like those from `pip` dependency resolution but improved) to detect and resolve version conflicts. 
   - Offer users a choice in conflict resolution, or automatically choose based on predefined strategies (e.g., minimal disruption).

4. **Caching and Speed Optimization**:
   - Implement caching mechanisms to store previously resolved dependencies to speed up subsequent builds.
   - Use multiprocessing or asynchronous operations for checking dependencies to reduce the time taken for installations.

5. **Documentation and Testing**:
   - Provide comprehensive documentation on how to use DepSimplify, including installation instructions, usage examples, and API documentation if applicable.
   - Include unit tests to verify the functionality of dependency resolution, CLI interactivity, and conflict handling.

**Setup Instructions**:
- Use Python 3.9+ for development.
- Create a new Replit project with Python environment.
- Set up version control with Git for code management.
- Use `poetry` or `pipenv` for managing the tool's own dependencies if possible.

**Deliverables**:
- A `DepSimplify` package that can be installed via `pip`.
- A command-line tool that users can run to manage dependencies.
- Documentation (README.md, possibly a Wiki or detailed comments within the code).
- Test suite to ensure robustness.

**Bonus Features** (if time allows):
- A web interface or an extension for IDEs like VSCode for visual dependency management.
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automatic dependency checks on code push.

**Start Coding**:
- Begin by setting up the project structure, planning the CLI layout, and sketching the dependency resolution logic.
- Use Python's vast ecosystem to leverage existing tools and libraries where possible, enhancing them with your unique features.

Remember, the universe is full of dependencies; we're just trying to manage them a bit more elegantly here on Earth. Go forth and simplify!
